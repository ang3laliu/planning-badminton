    <h2> Developing the database and integrating into the badminton site </h2>
        <hr>

    <h2> Relevant Implications: Describe </h2>
    <h3> Privacy: </h3>
    <p> There is little to be said about privacy as we have not touched on it much as a topic. The database should not
        be directly accessible by the user. For example http://127.0.0.1:8000/data should not take us to the data
        folder. Passwords should be hashed and the collection of a user's personal data should be handled with
        thought and care. For example, there is no point collecting their address and phone number. </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> This means that, at it's core, the database should work properly. It should not have errors and the data should
        be consistent in format. For example, using the SQLite data format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00" across the whole
        website. Foreign key references need to be correct, so for example, the correct member is associated with the
        news post that they made. Functionality can be addressed by creating precise entity relationship diagrams and
        an sql installer file, so that it is easy to implement small changes and corrections, and by thoroughly testing
        the database output on the web pages. </p>
    <h3> Sustainability and Future Proofing: </h3>
    <p> This means that the database should be easy to maintain. Any corrections to names, titles or dates should only
        happen in one place in the database, if they need to be used in other tables they should be referenced using
        foreign keys. For example, the members or users stored in the database; if their names are to be used in another
        part of the database, such as being associated with posting a news item, there should be a foreign key reference
        in the news table. This means that if a name is updated or other details are added, then the new name would
        appear in the news item, without having to make changes anywhere else. Overall, the database tables should be
        for different 'entities', people, classes, news items, schedule items etc. This also makes it easy to add new
        tables without altering what is already there. </p>
    <h3> End user considerations: </h3>
    <p> The data in the database needs to be queried and presented in a way that caters to the users needs. It should
        be presented in a clear organised structure and formatted to meet the expectations that users have for a
        modern website. Forms that allow the user to add, update or delete entries in the database should be simple
        to use and have validation to help the user avoid entering incorrect or partial information. </p>
    <hr>

    <h2> Starting design </h2>
    <p> This is my staring design for a database for my badminton website. The news page will be an important way of
        keeping people up to date with the latest news and upcoming events. The first priorty is to allow authorised
        users should be able to easily add a news item and they should also be able to update or delete one. Another
        useful features of the database will be the ability for non-authorised users to leave comments underneath news
        items on the website, and also a members table to keep track of the signups from new users. </p>

    <h3> Sprint Four </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p> To create the database aspect of my website, I will begin with building, running and testing two linked tables;
        a 'news' table and a 'member' table. The data plan for these tables is below: </p>

    </div>
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> Now that I have the sql installer file running, I can add to it and reinstall the database when necessary which
        will be very useful during this testing stage. After a series of false starts and failed attempts, I got the
        query to run and print out, using a testing file. This means I can work out and test a query before implementing
        in the flask server file. </p>

    <video controls>
        <source src="assets/vids/database-testing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> Realistically, the testing video above should have been filmed in Sprint Six to properly test the Add, Update
        and Delete buttons, however, I had already moved onto designing the login function before I was able to capture
        any evidence of trialling. This is the final sprint for the databases stage of my website and, unfortunately, I
        did not get around to creating a function for users to leave comments under news items - this is due to my poor
        management of time. Although, this could be seen as more accurate to other sports websites in real life that
        also do not have the option for users to comment, it's typically more reserved for their social media platforms.
        Another minor issue I would like to address is that the error message on the login page, "Your credentials are
        incorrect", is in plain black like the rest of the surrounding text. The lack of emphasis on the text is not
        helpful in assisting users with recognising and recovering from the error. In future, it could be worth making
        a simple edit (i.e. such as making the text red) to place more emphasis on the error and make it a bit more
        obvious to the user. It would have also been interesting to create a table for lessons and classes, however,
        it would have been an unrealistic goal given the time. </p>

    <h2> Relevant Implications: Address </h2>
    <h3> Privacy: </h3>
    <p> The database is not accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8000/data, this has been tested and the result is a page not
        found error. The main piece of personal information requested of the user, apart from their name, is their
        email. I have not asked for phone number or address as this is unnecessary and so the database is storing the
        minuimum of amount sensitive information we need. It would be good to hash the passwords, and that could be a
        further enhancement that could be added in the future. </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> The database has been tested regularly throughout the whole development process. By running test queries and
        using the data table viewer, I have checked that data such as dates and names are patterned and have a
        consistent format. Each piece of data appears only once in the database, for example a member's name. If it is
        required in other parts of the database, such as associating a member name with a news item, this is done using
        foreign keys. The sql installer file has helped me set up the database and I feel confident using it to make
        small changes and when rebuilding the database during the development process. I have made data fields unique
        wherever possible and not null as this means any repeated entries or missed fields are picked up quickly during
        development. </p>
    <h3> Sustainability and Future Proofing: </h3>
    <p> The relational design means that it is easy to add new features, such as comments and likes, as this would mean
        adding in a related table without having to change any pre-existing tables. Using foreign keys means that any
        updates, for example changing a member name or email, would only need to happen once and any use of it in other
        queries, such as for a comment or news item, would automatically update. </p>
    <h3> End user considerations: </h3>
    <p> The information in the database is managed and displayed through a website. This means that the data users read
        is presented in an accessible way that is styled in a manner that any user would be familiar with. Updating
        deleting and adding new data is managed through web forms, which again can be styled and is what the user would
        be most familar with. Once a change has been made, the page redirects to the place that the information is
        displayed, this could be the home/index page, news page, or one of the form pages, so that the user gets
        immediate confirmation that the action has taken place. Although an error page did not seem appropriate in
        this design, there are error messages present throughout the forms which help the user recognise and recover
        their mistakes, such as if the user had entered an invalid email or if their credentials are incorrect when
        attempting to login.</p>
