    <h2 id="id_brief"> Brief </h2>
    <p> Julie Bowen is the club director for the local Karori Badminton Club, and she is looking for a website to hold
        information and resources for this sports club. Julie and I have discussed some key aims for the site and after
        looking at some UX design principles, we decided to focus on: reviewing the types of users who will be accessing
        the site and the kind of design and experiences that they expect when they are online, and doing some competition
        analysis to get a sense of the design style and features of websites that perform similar functions.

    <h2 id="id_dri"> Relevant Implications: Describe </h2>
    <h3> Accessibility: </h3>
    <p> Web accessibility is an essential concept for creating and designing any website. It ensures that users of all
        abilities are able to access and use the site with ease, using tools provided by their computer. There are
        certain constructs in coding to make this possible for users; such as alt tags on images, heading tags and the
        use of em. </p>
    <h3> Aesthetics: </h3>
    <p> Aesthetics are important for how a website interacts with the user because the aesthetic ultimately determines
        if a user ‘likes’ a site. The CRAP method helped me determine how I would implement aesthetics to compliment my
        website. </p>
    <h3> Future-proofing: </h3>
    <p> Future proofing is about whether the website can be kept up to date. Can content be easily changed, old content
        removed and new content added. Often the end user of the website will not have significant technical knowledge
        of how the website works. So these users should be able to maintain the website using options that allow them to
        manage the web-site from the interface. This means having forms and option buttons and these only being
        available to an authorised user. By building a website that uses a database to store the page content and making
        options (such as buttons and form pages) available to manage the site content, the website can be continually
        kept up to date </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> Functionality can be checked through the process of testing. Under functionality, ensuring that my website
        performed at its best on all different browsers and user interfaces was essential, and this is typically
        achieved through regular testing of the digital media product during the design process. </p>
    <hr>


    <h3> Sprint One </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p>To complete a home page design, this includes trialling some different visuals and getting basic introductory
        content in.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ang3laliu/karori-badminton">Repository link</a></p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/sprint-one-1.jpg">
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> The subtitle text blends into the hero image which does not fulfil the 'C' in crap that stands for contrast, for
    text to be easy to read it must stand out from tbe background behind it. The hero image is also somewhat overdone,
    however, this much is sufficient for a first sprint. </p>
    <hr>


    <h3> Sprint Two </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p> To create a navigation bar and add elements to the home page </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/sprint-two-1.jpg">
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/sprint-two-2.jpg">
    <hr>


    <h3> Sprint Three </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p> To create the Play and Learn subpages </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/sprint-three-1.jpg">
    <br>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/sprint-three-2.jpg">
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> What I have noticed at this stage in my design process is that my pages have very little styling, which leaves
    the website itself feeling somewhat bare and incomplete. Focusing on the aesthetics and the front end of my site
    could be a good 'mini' goal alongside my future sprints.</p>

    <h2 id="id_database"> Developing the database and integrating into the Badminton site </h2>
    <h3> Relevant Implications: Describe </h3>
    <h3> Privacy: </h3>
    <p> There is little to be said about privacy as we have not touched on it much as a topic. The database should not
        be directly accessible by the user. For example http://127.0.0.1:8000/data should not take us to the data
        folder. Passwords should be hashed and the collection of a user's personal data should be handled with
        thought and care. For example, there is no point collecting their address and phone number. </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> This means that, at it's core, the database should work properly. It should not have errors and the data should
        be consistent in format. For example, using the SQLite data format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00" across the whole
        website. Foreign key references need to be correct, so for example, the correct member is associated with the
        news post that they made. Functionality can be addressed by creating precise entity relationship diagrams and
        a sql installer file, so that it is easy to implement small changes and corrections, and by thoroughly testing
        the database output on the web pages. </p>
    <h3> Sustainability and Future Proofing: </h3>
    <p> This means that the database should be easy to maintain. Any corrections to names, titles or dates should only
        happen in one place in the database, if they need to be used in other tables they should be referenced using
        foreign keys. For example, the members or users stored in the database; if their names are to be used in another
        part of the database, such as being associated with posting a news item, there should be a foreign key reference
        in the news table. This means that if a name is updated or other details are added, then the new name would
        appear in the news item, without having to make changes anywhere else. Overall, the database tables should be
        for different 'entities', people, classes, news items, schedule items etc. This also makes it easy to add new
        tables without altering what is already there. </p>
    <h3> End user considerations: </h3>
    <p> The data in the database needs to be queried and presented in a way that caters to the users needs. It should
        be presented in a clear organised structure and formatted to meet the expectations that users have for a
        modern website. Forms that allow the user to add, update or delete entries in the database should be simple
        to use and have validation to help the user avoid entering incorrect or partial information. </p>
    <hr>


    <div class=""><h2> Starting design </h2></div>
    <p> This is my staring design for a database for my badminton website. The news page will be an important way of
        keeping people up to date with the latest news and upcoming events. The first priority is to allow authorised
        users should be able to easily add a news item, and they should also be able to update or delete one. Another
        useful features of the database will be the ability for non-authorised users to leave comments underneath news
        items on the website, and also a members table to keep track of the signups from new users. </p>
    <img class="container-lg mb-2" src="assets/images/database-design.jpg">
    <hr>


    <h3> Sprint Four </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p> To create the database aspect of my website, I will begin with building, running and testing two linked tables;
        a 'news' table and a 'member' table. The data plan for these tables is below: </p>
    <img class="container-lg mb-2" src="assets/images/sprint-four-1.jpg">

        </div>
    </div>
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> Now that I have the sql installer file running, I can add to it and reinstall the database when necessary which
        will be very useful during this testing stage. After a series of false starts and failed attempts, I got the
        query to run and print out, using a testing file. This means I can work out and test a query before implementing
        in the flask server file. </p>

    <h3> Sprint Six </h3>
    <h3> Aim: </h3>
    <p> Design and build a form to go with the news page so that an authorised user can Create, Update, Delete news
        items. There are already buttons for each of these functions in place but the task now it to make them

    the news site. </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 my-2">

    <video controls>
        <source src="assets/vids/database-testing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <h3> Reflection: </h3>
    <p> Realistically, the testing video above should have been filmed in Sprint Six to properly test the Add, Update
        and Delete buttons, however, I had already moved onto designing the login function before I was able to capture
        any evidence of trialling. This is the final sprint for the databases stage of my website and, unfortunately, I
        did not get around to creating a function for users to leave comments under news items - this is due to my poor
        management of time. Although, this could be seen as more accurate to other sports websites in real life that
        also do not have the option for users to comment, it's typically more reserved for their social media platforms.
        Another minor issue I would like to address is that the error message on the login page, "Your credentials are
        incorrect", is in plain black like the rest of the surrounding text. The lack of emphasis on the text is not
        helpful in assisting users with recognising and recovering from the error. In the future, it could be worth making
        a simple edit (i.e. such as making the text red) to place more emphasis on the error and make it a bit more
        obvious to the user. It would have also been interesting to create a table for lessons and classes, however,
        it would have been an unrealistic goal given the time. </p>
    <hr>


    <h2> Relevant Implications: Address </h2>
    <h3> Privacy: </h3>
    <p> The database is not accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8000/data, this has been tested and the result is a page not
        found error. The main piece of personal information requested of the user, apart from their name, is their
        email. I have not asked for phone number or address as this is unnecessary and so the database is storing the
        minimum of amount sensitive information we need. It would be good to hash the passwords, and that could be a
        further enhancement that could be added in the future. </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> The database has been tested regularly throughout the whole development process. By running test queries and
        using the data table viewer, I have checked that data such as dates and names are patterned and have a
        consistent format. Each piece of data appears only once in the database, for example a member's name. If it is
        required in other parts of the database, such as associating a member name with a news item, this is done using
        foreign keys. The sql installer file has helped me set up the database and I feel confident using it to make
        small changes and when rebuilding the database during the development process. I have made data fields unique
        wherever possible and not null as this means any repeated entries or missed fields are picked up quickly during
        development. </p>
    <h3> Sustainability and Future Proofing: </h3>
    <p> The relational design means that it is easy to add new features, such as comments and likes, as this would mean
        adding in a related table without having to change any pre-existing tables. Using foreign keys means that any
        updates, for example changing a member name or email, would only need to happen once and any use of it in other
        queries, such as for a comment or news item, would automatically update. </p>
    <h3> End user considerations: </h3>
    <p> The information in the database is managed and displayed through a website. This means that the data users read
        is presented in an accessible way that is styled in a manner that any user would be familiar with. Updating
        deleting and adding new data is managed through web forms, which again can be styled and is what the user would
        be most familiar with. Once a change has been made, the page redirects to the place that the information is
        displayed, this could be the home/index page, news page, or one of the form pages, so that the user gets
        immediate confirmation that the action has taken place. Although an error page did not seem appropriate in
        this design, there are error messages present throughout the forms which help the user recognise and recover
        their mistakes, such as if the user had entered an invalid email or if their credentials are incorrect when
        attempting to log in.</p>
    <hr>


    <h2> BACK TO THE WEBSITE -----></h2>
    <hr>


    <h2 id="id_ari"> Relevant Implications: Address </h2>
    <h3> Accessibility: </h3>
    <p> I have used
        certain constructs in the coding to make this possible for users. I have added alt tags to all of my images
        with a short but comprehensive explanation of what is depicted in the photo. This means that if the images do
        not load, the user can still get an understanding of the image that was there. This also enables users who are
        blind and use a screen reader to read out the alt tag to understand what the image is without being able to see
        it. Another construct I used was the heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6). This helped me structure the site
        by giving the text a structure. Text inside h1 comes first before h2, then h3 and so on. This allows a user
        with a screen reader to clearly comprehend the importance and structure of the information on the page. In the
        future, it would be beneficial to make use of the em feature in html. This would mean that the font will adapt
        to the user’s screen settings, by setting the font size to 100% in the body and using em measurement to control
        the proportion of sizing. For example, if I made some text 3em, it means that with a user's special font
        settings, the text will appear 3 times larger than the default size, no matter how small or large the initial
        font size is. </p>
    <h3> Aesthetics: </h3>
    <p> Contrast: I have used subheadings to help break up the information into bite-sized chunks which can easily be
        digested. I have used high quality images throughout my website to help draw the users in and create contrast
        from the text on the page. It keeps the page interesting and helps to break up information.<br><br>
        Repetition: For the subpages on my site, I created a banner that would repetitively appear at the top of every
        page. This visually shows that each page belongs to the one website. The banner is also repeated with the title
        of each page so the user know which page they are on.<br><br>
        Alignment & Proximity: Together, these two considerations help the page look simple and clean. The built-in
        containers, rows and columns from Bootstrap 5 helped to keep the content in line, with consistent margins and
        padding across all areas of text as well as around images. The proximity and alignment also because important
        when I decided to include three cards for the three types of badminton classes, one at each age group.
    </p>
    <h3> Future-proofing: </h3>
    <p> My stakeholder, Julie Bowen, the director for Karori Badminton Hall and the person who will maintain the state
        of the website has no coding experience. Although Julie may need some assistance if she would like to make
        major changes to the website itself, such as adding a subpage or editing the content, the news page is very
        sustainable for the average user. Once logged in, Julie and other authorised club members are free to add,
        update and delete news items on the website which should make up most of the ‘changes’ they will want to make. </p>
    <h3> Functionality: </h3>
    <p> The functionality of my final product is overall somewhat questionable when taken down to a smaller screen size,
        however, I can acknowledge that there are several steps I could and should have taken in order to maximise the
        functionality of my end product. In the future, it would be essential to; test the appearance of my site on
        different screens often, make more use of the built-in containers provided by Bootstrap and remember that
        problems tend to build up quickly if not addressed before continuing onwards in the design process. </p>
